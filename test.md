This is a sample of a ReadME created by using the command line to generate one. This both saves the developer time, and generates consistency amongst all ReadMEs. Nodes Inquirer package module is utilized to generate prompts that the user responds to in the command line. The prompts follow GitHubs README.md guidelines outlining all elements of a quality ReadME.
